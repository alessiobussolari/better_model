  # Archivable Example (Opt-In)
  # ========================================
  # Uncomment to enable archivable functionality:
  #
  # archivable do
  #   skip_archived_by_default true  # Nasconde archiviati di default
  # end
  #
  # Usage:
  #   article.archive!(by: user, reason: "Outdated content")
  #   article.archived?  # => true
  #   article.restore!
  #
  #   Article.archived                    # Scope: find archived
  #   Article.not_archived                # Scope: find active
  #   Article.archived_at_within(7.days)  # Predicate: archived recently
  #   Article.archived_today              # Helper: archived today
  #
  #   Article.search({ archived_at_null: true, status_eq: "published" })
