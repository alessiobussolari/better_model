Stateable column has been added to your model!

Next steps:

1. Run the migration:
   $ bin/rails db:migrate

2. Add Stateable configuration to your model:

   class <%= model_name %> < ApplicationRecord
     include BetterModel

     stateable do
       # Define states
       state :<%= initial_state_value %>, initial: true
       state :confirmed
       state :completed

       # Define transitions
       transition :confirm, from: :<%= initial_state_value %>, to: :confirmed do
         guard { valid? }
         before { prepare_confirmation }
         after { send_notification }
       end

       transition :complete, from: :confirmed, to: :completed
     end
   end

3. Don't forget to create the state_transitions table (once per app):
   $ bin/rails generate better_model:stateable:install
   $ bin/rails db:migrate
