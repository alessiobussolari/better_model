    "Include BetterModel in ActiveRecord models to enable all features at once with 'include BetterModel'",
    "Each feature (Statusable, Permissible, Predicable, Sortable, Searchable) is automatically available when BetterModel is included",
    "Opt-in features require explicit activation: Archivable (with archived_at column), Validatable (with configuration block), Stateable (with state and transitions columns), Traceable (with version_records table), Taggable (with tags JSONB column)",
    "Use Rails generators to create required migrations: 'rails generate better_model:archivable MODEL', 'rails generate better_model:stateable MODEL', 'rails generate better_model:traceable MODEL', 'rails generate better_model:taggable MODEL'",
    "PostgreSQL provides additional predicates: overlaps, contains, contained_by for arrays; has_key, has_value, has_path for JSONB columns",
    "Statusable declarations: use 'is :status_name, -> { condition }' to define dynamic boolean statuses based on model state and attributes",
    "Permissible declarations: use 'permit :action_name, -> { condition }' to define action permissions based on model state",
    "State machines: use 'state_machine initial: :state_name' with 'state :name, from: [:state1], to: :state2' declarations",
    "Searchable accepts: text fields for full-text search, exact fields for exact matches, range fields for numeric/date ranges, boolean fields, enum fields, and custom scopes",
    "Change tracking: Traceable automatically tracks all changes to model attributes, storing versions with changes hash, whodunnit (user), and metadata",
    "Always use transaction blocks when performing state transitions or updates that involve multiple records",
    "The gem requires Rails 8.1+ and Ruby 3.0+ minimum"
