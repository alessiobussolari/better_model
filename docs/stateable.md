## Overview

**Key Features:**

- **🎯 Opt-in Activation**: Stateable is not active by default. You must explicitly enable it with `stateable do...end`.
- **📊 Explicit States**: Define all possible states upfront with clear initial state.
- **🔐 Conditional Transitions**: Protect state changes with check conditions (blocks, methods, or Statusable predicates).
- **✅ Transition Validations**: Add custom validation logic to transitions.
- **🎣 Rich Callbacks**: before, after, and around callbacks for transition lifecycle.
- **📜 Complete History**: Track all state transitions with metadata and timestamps.
- **🤝 Statusable Integration**: Use Statusable predicates as check conditions.
- **🔗 Flexible Table Naming**: Shared or per-model transition tables.
- **🛡️ Thread-safe**: Immutable configuration and registry.
- **⚡ Database Transaction**: All transitions wrapped in transactions for consistency.

## Setup

### Quick Start with Generator

Use the built-in generators to quickly set up Stateable:

```bash
# Install state transitions table (shared by all models)
rails g better_model:stateable:install
rails db:migrate

# Configure specific model (generates initializer)
rails g better_model:stateable Order
```

### Manual Setup

Create the state transitions table manually:

```ruby
# db/migrate/XXXXXX_create_state_transitions.rb
class CreateStateTransitions < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.1]
  def change
    create_table :state_transitions do |t|
      t.string :transitionable_type, null: false  # Polymorphic type
      t.bigint :transitionable_id, null: false    # Polymorphic ID
      t.string :event, null: false                 # Transition event name
      t.string :from_state, null: false            # Previous state
      t.string :to_state, null: false              # New state
      t.json :metadata                             # Optional metadata (PostgreSQL: jsonb)

      t.timestamps                                  # created_at, updated_at
    end

    add_index :state_transitions, [:transitionable_type, :transitionable_id]
    add_index :state_transitions, :event
    add_index :state_transitions, :created_at
  end
end
```

**Add state column to your model:**

```ruby
# db/migrate/XXXXXX_add_state_to_orders.rb
class AddStateToOrders < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.1]
  def change
    add_column :orders, :state, :string, null: false, default: "pending"
    add_index :orders, :state
  end
end
```

## Basic Configuration

### Defining States

Enable Stateable and define all possible states:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  stateable do
    # Define states
    state :pending, initial: true  # Initial state (required)
    state :confirmed
    state :paid
    state :shipped
    state :delivered
    state :cancelled
  end
end
```

**Important:**

- At least one state must be marked with `initial: true`
- Only one initial state is allowed
- All states must be defined before transitions
- States are symbols

### Defining Transitions

Define transitions between states:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
    state :paid
    state :cancelled

    # Simple transition
    transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed

    # Transition from multiple states
    transition :cancel, from: [:pending, :confirmed, :paid], to: :cancelled

    # Transition with block configuration
    transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
      check { payment_method.present? }
      before_transition { charge_payment }
      after_transition { send_receipt }
    end
  end
end
```

**Transition Syntax:**

```ruby
transition :event_name, from: :source_state, to: :target_state do
  # Optional: checks, validations, callbacks
end
```

## Checks

Checks are preconditions that must be met for a transition to be allowed. There are three types of checks:

### Block Checks

Evaluate a block in the instance context:

```ruby
stateable do
  state :pending, initial: true
  state :confirmed

  transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
    # Multiple checks - ALL must pass
    check { items.any? }
    check { customer.present? }
    check { total_amount > 0 }
  end
end
```

**Block checks:**
- Executed in instance context (`self` is the model instance)
- Must return truthy/falsy value
- Can access any instance methods or attributes
- Multiple checks are AND-ed (all must pass)

### Method Checks

Call a method on the instance:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed

    transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
      check :customer_valid?
      check :stock_available?
    end
  end

  private

  def customer_valid?
    customer.present? && customer.email.present?
  end

  def stock_available?
    items.all? { |item| item.in_stock? }
  end
end
```

**Method checks:**
- Cleaner for complex logic
- Reusable across transitions
- Can be private methods
- Must return truthy/falsy value

### Predicate Checks (Statusable Integration)

Use Statusable predicates as checks:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  # Define Statusable predicates
  statusable do
    status :ready_to_ship do
      paid? && address.present? && !cancelled?
    end

    status :payable do
      confirmed? && payment_method.present?
    end
  end

  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
    state :paid
    state :shipped

    transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
      check if: :is_payable?  # Uses Statusable predicate
    end

    transition :ship, from: :paid, to: :shipped do
      check if: :is_ready_to_ship?
    end
  end
end
```

**Predicate checks:**
- Requires Statusable concern
- Uses `check if: :predicate_name` syntax
- Automatically prefixes with `is_` if Statusable is enabled
- Great for complex derived conditions

## Validations

Add custom validation logic to transitions:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
    state :paid

    transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
      validate do
        errors.add(:base, "Must have at least one item") if items.empty?
        errors.add(:customer, "is required") if customer.blank?
        errors.add(:shipping_address, "is required") if shipping_address.blank?
      end
    end

    transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
      validate do
        errors.add(:payment_method, "is required") if payment_method.blank?
        errors.add(:total, "must be greater than 0") if total_amount <= 0
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Validation behavior:**

- Runs after checks (checks must pass first)
- Should add errors to `errors` object
- If any errors exist after validation, transition fails with `ValidationFailedError`
- Can add multiple validation blocks (all will be executed)

## Callbacks

### Before Callbacks

Execute logic before the state changes:

```ruby
stateable do
  state :pending, initial: true
  state :confirmed

  transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
    # Block callback
    before_transition { calculate_total }

    # Method callback
    before_transition :send_confirmation_email

    # Multiple callbacks (executed in order)
    before_transition :update_inventory
    before_transition :notify_warehouse
  end
end
```

**Before callbacks:**
- Execute before state is changed
- Execute after checks and validations pass
- Changes are not saved yet (can modify the record)
- If an exception is raised, transaction rolls back

### After Callbacks

Execute logic after the state changes:

```ruby
stateable do
  state :confirmed, initial: true
  state :paid

  transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
    # Block callback
    after_transition { update_accounting }

    # Method callback
    after_transition :send_receipt

    # Multiple callbacks
    after_transition :update_loyalty_points
    after_transition :schedule_shipping
  end
end
```

**After callbacks:**
- Execute after state is saved to database
- State transition record is already created
- If an exception is raised, transaction rolls back
- Great for side effects like emails, notifications

### Around Callbacks

Wrap the entire transition:

```ruby
stateable do
  state :pending, initial: true
  state :confirmed

  transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
    around do |transition|
      start_time = Time.current

      # Before transition
      Rails.logger.info "Starting confirmation at #{start_time}"

      # Execute transition
      transition.call

      # After transition
      duration = Time.current - start_time
      Rails.logger.info "Confirmation completed in #{duration}s"
    end
  end
end
```

**Around callbacks:**
- Must call `transition.call` to execute the transition
- Can wrap with logging, timing, exception handling
- Executed in instance context
- Can be nested (multiple around callbacks)

**Nested around callbacks:**

```ruby
transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
  around do |transition|
    Rails.logger.info "Outer start"
    transition.call
    Rails.logger.info "Outer end"
  end

  around do |transition|
    Rails.logger.info "Inner start"
    transition.call
    Rails.logger.info "Inner end"
  end
end

# Execution order:
# 1. Outer start
# 2. Inner start
# 3. [actual transition]
# 4. Inner end
# 5. Outer end
```

## State History Tracking

Stateable automatically tracks all state transitions:

```ruby
order = Order.create!(customer: customer)
# state: "pending"

order.confirm!
# Creates StateTransition record

order.pay!
# Creates another StateTransition record

# Query history
order.state_transitions
# => [
#   #<StateTransition event: "pay", from_state: "confirmed", to_state: "paid", created_at: ...>,
#   #<StateTransition event: "confirm", from_state: "pending", to_state: "confirmed", created_at: ...>
# ]

# Formatted history
order.transition_history
# => [
#   {event: "pay", from: "confirmed", to: "paid", at: 2025-01-15 14:30:00, metadata: {}},
#   {event: "confirm", from: "pending", to: "confirmed", at: 2025-01-15 10:00:00, metadata: {}}
# ]
```

### Adding Metadata to Transitions

Pass metadata when transitioning:

```ruby
order.confirm!(
  user_id: current_user.id,
  ip_address: request.remote_ip,
  notes: "Confirmed via admin panel"
)

# Retrieve metadata
order.state_transitions.first.metadata
# => {
#   "user_id" => 123,
#   "ip_address" => "192.168.1.1",
#   "notes" => "Confirmed via admin panel"
# }
```

### Include History in JSON

```ruby
order.as_json(include_transition_history: true)
# => {
#   "id" => 1,
#   "state" => "paid",
#   "transition_history" => [
#     {event: "pay", from: "confirmed", to: "paid", at: ..., metadata: {...}},
#     {event: "confirm", from: "pending", to: "confirmed", at: ..., metadata: {...}}
#   ]
# }
```

## Generated Methods

Stateable automatically generates methods for each state and transition:

### State Predicate Methods

```ruby
stateable do
  state :pending, initial: true
  state :confirmed
  state :paid
end

# Generated methods:
order.pending?    # => true
order.confirmed?  # => false
order.paid?       # => false
```

### Transition Methods

```ruby
stateable do
  state :pending, initial: true
  state :confirmed

  transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed
end

# Generated methods:
order.confirm!       # Execute transition (raises on failure)
order.can_confirm?   # Check if transition is allowed (tests check conditions)

# Usage
if order.can_confirm?
  order.confirm!
else
  puts "Cannot confirm order"
end
```

### Method Naming Convention

| Declaration | Generated Methods |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `state :pending` | `pending?` |
| `state :confirmed` | `confirmed?` |
| `transition :confirm` | `confirm!`, `can_confirm?` |
| `transition :pay` | `pay!`, `can_pay?` |
| `transition :ship` | `ship!`, `can_ship?` |

## Table Naming Options

### Shared Table (Default)

Use a single table for all models:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    # Uses 'state_transitions' table (default)
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
  end
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    # Uses same 'state_transitions' table
    state :draft, initial: true
    state :published
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Single audit trail across all models
- Centralized state history
- Easy cross-model queries

**Cons:**
- Large table over time
- Requires good indexing

### Per-Model Table

Use separate tables for each model:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    transitions_table 'order_state_transitions'
    state :pending, initial: true
  end
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    transitions_table 'article_state_transitions'
    state :draft, initial: true
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Clear separation per model
- Easier to partition/archive
- Independent evolution

**Cons:**
- More tables to manage

### Custom Shared Table

Use domain-specific naming:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    transitions_table 'commerce_state_log'
    state :pending, initial: true
  end
end

class Payment < ApplicationRecord
  stateable do
    transitions_table 'commerce_state_log'  # Same table
    state :pending, initial: true
  end
end
```

## Database Schema

### State Transitions Table

```ruby
create_table :state_transitions do |t|
  # Polymorphic association (required)
  t.string :transitionable_type, null: false
  t.bigint :transitionable_id, null: false

  # Transition data (required)
  t.string :event, null: false
  t.string :from_state, null: false
  t.string :to_state, null: false

  # Metadata (optional but recommended)
  t.json :metadata  # or t.jsonb :metadata (PostgreSQL)

  # Timestamps (required)
  t.timestamps
end

# Indexes (required for performance)
add_index :state_transitions, [:transitionable_type, :transitionable_id]
add_index :state_transitions, :event
add_index :state_transitions, :created_at
add_index :state_transitions, [:transitionable_type, :transitionable_id, :created_at], name: 'index_state_transitions_on_transitionable_and_created_at'
```

### Model State Column

```ruby
# Add state column to your model table
add_column :orders, :state, :string, null: false, default: "pending"
add_index :orders, :state
```

## Integration with Other Concerns

### With Statusable

Use Statusable for derived statuses:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  # Statusable for derived statuses
  statusable do
    status :payable do
      confirmed? && payment_method.present? && !cancelled?
    end

    status :shippable do
      paid? && shipping_address.present?
    end
  end

  # Stateable for state machine
  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
    state :paid
    state :shipped

    transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
      check if: :is_payable?  # Uses Statusable
    end

    transition :ship, from: :paid, to: :shipped do
      check if: :is_shippable?
    end
  end
end
```

### With Traceable

Track all state changes in audit trail:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  # Track state changes
  traceable do
    track :state, :cancelled_at, :shipped_at
  end

  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :shipped
    state :cancelled

    transition :ship, from: :pending, to: :shipped do
      before_transition { self.shipped_at = Time.current }
    end

    transition :cancel, from: [:pending, :confirmed], to: :cancelled do
      before_transition { self.cancelled_at = Time.current }
    end
  end
end

# State changes are tracked in both systems
order.ship!
# Creates StateTransition record
# Creates Traceable version record with state change
```

### With Archivable

Handle archival as a state:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  include BetterModel

  archivable do
    with_reason
  end

  stateable do
    state :draft, initial: true
    state :published
    state :archived

    transition :publish, from: :draft, to: :published
    transition :archive, from: :published, to: :archived do
      before_transition { archive!(reason: "Moved to archived state") }
    end
  end
end
```

## Real-world Examples

### E-commerce Order Workflow

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  has_many :items
  belongs_to :payment_method, optional: true

  include BetterModel

  statusable do
    status :ready_to_confirm do
      items.any? && customer.present? && shipping_address.present?
    end

    status :ready_to_pay do
      confirmed? && payment_method.present?
    end
  end

  stateable do
    state :pending, initial: true
    state :confirmed
    state :paid
    state :processing
    state :shipped
    state :delivered
    state :cancelled
    state :refunded

    transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
      check if: :is_ready_to_confirm?

      validate do
        errors.add(:base, "Minimum order amount not met") if total_amount < 10
      end

      before_transition :calculate_final_total
      before_transition :reserve_inventory
      after_transition :send_confirmation_email
    end

    transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
      check if: :is_ready_to_pay?

      validate do
        errors.add(:payment_method, "declined") unless payment_method.valid?
      end

      before_transition :charge_payment
      after_transition :send_receipt
      after_transition :schedule_processing
    end

    transition :process, from: :paid, to: :processing do
      before_transition :notify_warehouse
    end

    transition :ship, from: :processing, to: :shipped do
      check { tracking_number.present? }

    end

    transition :refund, from: [:paid, :processing, :shipped], to: :refunded do
      check { refundable? }

      before_transition :process_refund
      after_transition :send_refund_notification
    end
  end

  private

  def calculate_final_total
    self.total_amount = items.sum(&:price) + shipping_cost
  end

  def reserve_inventory
    items.each(&:reserve!)
  end

  def charge_payment
    payment_method.charge!(total_amount)
  end

  def refundable?
    paid_at > 30.days.ago
  end
end
```

### Document Approval Workflow

## Error Handling

Stateable raises specific errors for different failure scenarios:

```ruby
# NotEnabledError - Stateable not enabled
begin
  order.confirm!
rescue BetterModel::Stateable::NotEnabledError => e
  # Stateable is not enabled. Add 'stateable do...end' to your model.
end

# InvalidTransitionError - Invalid state transition
begin
  order.ship!  # But order is still "pending"
rescue BetterModel::InvalidTransitionError => e
  e.message
  # => "Cannot transition from 'pending' to 'shipped' via 'ship'"
  e.event       # => :ship
  e.from_state  # => "pending"
  e.to_state    # => "shipped"
end

# CheckFailedError - Check condition not met
begin
  order.pay!  # But payment_method is nil
rescue BetterModel::CheckFailedError => e
  e.message
  # => "Check failed for transition 'pay': method check: payment_method_present?"
  e.event        # => :pay
  e.check_description  # => "method check: payment_method_present?"
end

# ValidationFailedError - Validation failed
begin
  order.confirm!  # But items array is empty
rescue BetterModel::ValidationFailedError => e
  e.message
  # => "Validation failed for transition 'confirm': Must have at least one item"
  e.event   # => :confirm
  e.errors  # => ActiveModel::Errors object
end
```

### Handling Errors in Controllers

```ruby
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def confirm
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    @order.confirm!(user_id: current_user.id)

    redirect_to @order, notice: "Order confirmed"
  rescue BetterModel::InvalidTransitionError
    redirect_to @order, alert: "Order cannot be confirmed in current state"
  rescue BetterModel::CheckFailedError => e
    redirect_to @order, alert: "Cannot confirm: #{e.check_description}"
  rescue BetterModel::ValidationFailedError => e
    redirect_to @order, alert: "Validation failed: #{e.errors.full_messages.join(', ')}"
  end
end
```

### Conditional Transitions with Error Handling

```ruby
if order.can_confirm?
  begin
    order.confirm!(user_id: current_user.id, notes: params[:notes])
    flash[:notice] = "Order confirmed successfully"
  rescue BetterModel::ValidationFailedError => e
    flash[:alert] = "Validation failed: #{e.errors.full_messages.join(', ')}"
  end
else
  flash[:alert] = "Order cannot be confirmed at this time"
end
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Define all states explicitly** - Make the state machine complete and clear
- **Use initial state** - Always specify which state is initial
- **Keep states simple** - States should be nouns (pending, confirmed), not verbs
- **Use checks liberally** - Prevent invalid transitions with check conditions
- **Validate business rules** - Use validations for complex business logic
- **Track metadata** - Pass context (user_id, reason, etc.) when transitioning
- **Use before callbacks for side effects** - Database updates, calculations
- **Use after callbacks for notifications** - Emails, webhooks, logging
- **Name transitions as verbs** - confirm, pay, ship (actions that cause state change)
- **Test transition paths** - Ensure all paths through state machine work
- **Use Statusable integration** - Derive complex conditions as status predicates

### ❌ Don't

- **Don't bypass the state machine** - Always use transition methods, not direct `update(state: ...)`
- **Don't make states too granular** - Too many states make the machine complex
- **Don't forget initial state** - Every state machine needs a starting point
- **Don't skip validations** - Use validations to enforce business rules
- **Don't use callbacks for business logic** - Checks and validations are better
- **Don't ignore errors** - Handle transition errors appropriately
- **Don't track non-state data** - Use Traceable for change tracking
- **Don't skip indexes** - State transitions table needs proper indexes
- **Don't mix concerns** - State is persistent, status is derived (use Statusable)

### State Machine Design

```ruby
# ✅ Good: Clear states and transitions
stateable do
  state :draft, initial: true
  state :published
  state :archived

  transition :publish, from: :draft, to: :published
  transition :archive, from: :published, to: :archived
  transition :unarchive, from: :archived, to: :draft
end

# ❌ Bad: Too granular
stateable do
  state :created
  state :validating
  state :validated
  state :processing
  state :processed
  state :finalizing
  state :finalized
  # Too many states!
end
```

### Check vs Validation

```ruby
# ✅ Good: Use checks for preconditions
transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
  check { payment_method.present? }  # Precondition

  validate do
    # Business rule validation
    errors.add(:total, "too high") if total_amount > customer.credit_limit
  end
end

# ❌ Bad: Using validation for preconditions
transition :pay, from: :confirmed, to: :paid do
  validate do
    errors.add(:payment_method, "required") if payment_method.nil?  # Should be check
  end
end
```

### Callback Usage

```ruby
# ✅ Good: Clear separation of concerns
transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
  before :calculate_total       # Modify record before state change
  before :reserve_inventory     # Update related data

  after :send_confirmation      # Side effects after state saved
  after :notify_warehouse       # External notifications
end

# ❌ Bad: Business logic in callbacks
transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
  before do
    if items.empty?
      # Don't do validation in callbacks!
      raise "No items"
    end
  end
end

# Should be:
transition :confirm, from: :pending, to: :confirmed do
  check { items.any? }  # Or use validate block
end
```
